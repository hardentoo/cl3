# cl3
Haskell Library implementing standard functions for the Algebra of Physical Space Cl(3,0)

The goal of the Cl3 library is to provide a specialized, safe, high performance, Algebra of Physical Space implementaiton.
This library is suitable for physics simulations.  The library integrates into Haskell's standard prelude and has few dependancies.
The library uses a GADT to specialize to specific graded elements in the Algebra of Physical Space.
